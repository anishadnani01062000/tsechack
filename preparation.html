What is GRE?
</h4>
<p style="font-size: 15px;">The GRE General Test is the world�s largest assessment program for graduate admissions. Full-form of GRE is Graduate Record Examination. Over a half million individuals take the GRE General Test in over 1,000 test centers in 160 countries every year, and scores are accepted at thousands of graduate programs around the world, for masters and doctoral degrees. More than 1,200 business schools around the world accept the GRE, including top-ranked MBA programs according to The Financial Times, U.S. News & World Report and Bloomberg Businessweek. And a handful (currently 19) law schools in the US accept GRE scores, including a few of the very best schools: Harvard, Columbia, Georgetown, and Northwestern.
</p>
<p style="font-size: 15px;">
GRE also has subject tests, apart from the basic GRE exam. These subject tests help to make your application stand out from the rest by highlighting your subject knowledge and skill level of a particular subject. Each subject test is intended for those students who have a bachelor's degree in the particular disciplines. The subject tests being offered currently are Biochemistry, Biology, Chemistry, Literature, Mathematics, Physics, and Psychology. The Graduate Record Examination (GRE) is a standardized test that is required to be taken by students seeking admission to graduate schools. The exam has been developed to evaluate the verbal, analytical and mathematical skills of the candidates. GRE is a computer-based test and has a user-friendly design. Individuals applying to graduate schools in order to pursue a Masters of Science (MS) or MBA are required to take the exam.
</p>
<h4 style ="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bolder;color: green;">
GRE Eligibility
</h4>
<p style="font-size: 15px;">
GRE or Graduate Record Examination is undertaken for admission to Graduate Programmes abroad. Hence, candidates who plan to appear for GRE are required to have successfully completed their Undergraduate course to be eligible for GRE. Students can register for the exam irrespective of age and qualification. Candidates should note that not all programmes and universities require candidates to have a GRE score for their Graduate Programme. Whether a candidate requires to appear for his GRE is entirely dependent on the university and the course he is pursuing.

TOEFL
</h4>
<p style="font-size: 15px;">
TOEFL is the most popular English proficiency exam accepted at North American universities. The full form of TOEFL is Test of English as Foreign Language. TOEFL tests the international students� usage and understanding of North American English as it is spoken, written and heard in college and university settings. The TOEFL test is developed and administered by Educational Testing Service (ETS), which sets the questions, conducts the test, and sends each examinee the score report.

Often, students are confused if they need to prepare only for TOEFL or other exams are also required for admission to the US and Canadian universities. How many exams you need to prepare completely depends on the type of course you are applying to. For all undergraduate courses in the US and some in Canada, you need to prepare for SAT. For MBA courses GMAT scores are a requirement; similarly, for MS courses GRE scores are relevant. Along with all these exams, you have to take either IELTS or TOEFL.

Often international students don�t know how to choose between IELTS or TOEFL, as universities abroad ask for either exam scores. Since TOEFL syllabus is designed to test your understanding of North-American English, it should be your first choice if you are applying to universities in US and Canada. For rest of the countries, especially the UK and Australia, IELTS is usually the more preferred language exam, but TOEFL is also accepted.

TOEFL test is conducted round the year and has more than 50 test dates per year. You can retake the test as many times as you wish, but to take a re-test you have to wait for a 12-day period after attempting the first test.
</p>
<h4 style ="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bolder;color: green;">TOEFL Eligibility Criteria</h4>
<p style="font-size: 15px;">
ETS, the body that conducts TOEFL, have not specified any specific eligibility criteria for giving the TOEFL exam. It is a language proficiency test which is taken by those who want to move to a foreign land in order to pursue study or work and gain global exposure. This is generally given for getting admission in colleges, universities or organizations of English speaking countries. Generally, candidates who cleared high school or equivalent appear for the TOEFL exams.
</p>
<h4 style ="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bolder;color: green;">TOEFL Dates</h4>
<p style="font-size: 15px;">
Your target date for taking the TOEFL exam should be at least a month before your first application deadline. This will give you plenty of time to work on your applications, and in case you need to retake the exam you can do so after 12 days of the first attempt.
</p>
<p style="font-size: 15px;">
So if the deadline for your application is November, you should take the exam by October. If you feel the need to retake TOEFL, you can take it in the latter half of October again. You can retake the TOEFL after 12 days post your first attempt.

SAT Exam
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 15px;">
SAT is a standardized test administered by the College Board and is required to be taken by students seeking admission in undergraduate schools. SAT exam has been developed to evaluate the written, verbal and mathematical skills of the candidates. 

Applicants to undergraduate courses, particularly in US and Canada, are required to take the SAT exam. If the student is looking to get admission to a particular course, s/he can take the SAT subject tests to show his knowledge and understanding of that particular subject. Subject tests are offered in areas like Literature, History, Mathematics, Sciences and Foreign Languages.

A recent review of admissions policies by The National Center for Fair & Open Testing (FairTest) revealed that many colleges have moved away from SAT subject test, which some years back was crucial for admission to top American universities. 

</p>
<h4 style ="font-family: sans-serif;font-size: 20px; font-weight: bolder;color: green; font-family:san">Scoring in SAT</h4>
<p style="font-size: 15px;">
The SAT is divided into two sections - 1. Reading, Writing, and 2.Mathematics. These two sections are scored on a 200-800 point scale, for a maximum total score of 1600. 

SAT subject test scores are measured on a scale of 200 to 800. There are additional subscores reported on a 20-80 scale. The scores of a student reflect on how he/she compared with other students who took the test. An average SAT score is around 1000. Anything above 1200 is considered a good SAT score. The maximum anyone can score on SAT is the perfect score of 1600. Since you receive scaled scores, you should have some understanding of SAT scaled scores and percentiles.
</p>
<h4 style ="font-family: sans-serif;font-size: 20px; font-weight: bolder;color: green;"> 
SAT Dates</h4>
<p style="font-size: 15px;">The SAT is conducted only a few times a year between October to June. You don�t have the luxury of selecting an exam date suitable as per your convenience, which is the case with other exams. You need to plan your exam prep according to these test dates. These exams are scheduled to suit your application deadlines for the fall semester.
