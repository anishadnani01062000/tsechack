<p>Although GRE is considered to be an important criteria for one's application status but it is not 
the only criteria one also needs to focus on toefl,cumulative grade pointer,infield competitions,
infield projects and much more mentioned below<p>

<p><h1>GPA</h1> - Most IMPORTANT part of a student�s profile. Most US University have a minimum requirement of 3 out of 4. However to get into top schools a 3.5+ GPA is advisable. Most importantly have very good grades in the subject you intend to specialise.
GRE score - Since you are planning for MS , target atleast 320+ with 165+ in quants. For top schools a 330+ GRE score with 168�170 in quant is advisable.
<h1>TOEFL Score</h1>- Anything above 100 would be good. Most schools have a minimum requirement of 80�90. TOEFL Score does matter when you are considered for TA/RA. Target 26+ in Speaking if you want TA/RA.
<h1>Statement of Purpose</h1>- Write a great SOP highlighting your research interests , why you want to study in that particular school , where do you see yourself in future , which professor�s reasearch work excites you etc.
<h1>Letter of Recommendations</h1> - Get strong LORs from your teachers or employers. Always get LOR from people who know you well & are likely to write something positive about you. High profile LOR from someone who hardly knows won�t help much. Better to get it from your teacher under whom you did your project or you manager in the company.
<h1>Projects & Internships</h1>- Do a lot of projects & internships in your field of interest. They definetly add a lot of value to your profile.
<h1>Paper</h1>- If possible publish a National or International paper. That will immensely strengthen your profile. In order to get into top schools it is advisable to publish 1�2 paper.
<h1>Work Experience</h1>- Even though work experience is not mandatory for MS , but it helps to have some work experience.</P>
